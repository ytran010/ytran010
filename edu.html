    </br>
    </br>
    </br>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my Education page! A little bit about me and my relationship to education in general: There's so much to learn about the world. It's impossible too know everything, and yet as humans living in a world where there is an endless amount of information, it's our job
        to expand our horizons, to learn as much as possible, and continue to progress from our current state, to always seek for better. On this page, I do have institutions in which I obtained official education, but these are just institutions. These are formal and more credible forms of
        education. Education can go beyond these institutions. It's my belief that progression of knowledge beyond these institutions is just as important as receiving knowedge from them. 
    </br>
    </br>   
    The Bottom Line: It's always my goal to learn as much as I can.

        <h4 id="list-item-1">High School</h4>
        <p>Since the age of 5, I had been studying classical piano with a private teacher. Because I had so much experience in piano, and because I was gifted with an amazing teacher, I played very well. So well, in fact, that I was accepted to an art school in middle school. This art school went from grade 
            7 to grade 12, and that is why I'm including this in my High School education. Orange County School of the Arts, better known as OCSA, is a charter school that excels in all art forms. Because I was accepted into the Piano Conservatory, I participated in piano academia every day, except Friday, 
            after general high school studies. While it was very intensive, I'm very appreciative of the experience because I learned things that many other people are not fortunate enough to learn. The diverse and supportive environment promoted growth, individuality, and communication. It was an amazing 5 years 
            of my attendance, and I am very fortunate to have graduated from this amazing school.
        </p>
        <h4 id="list-item-2">University</h4>
        <p>Upon graduating from OCSA, I was accepted into University of California, also known as UCR, as a Neuroscience Major. You may be confused, since my resume displays a BA in Economics, not a BA in Neuroscience. But I'll explain. My parents always had their dream of me becoming a Doctor. Before I had matured, 
            I followed their dream. It was only when I was nearly halfway with my Neuroscience degree when I realized that this was not my dream, but theirs. I didn't want to become a doctor. After taking an Economics course, I fell in love with the graphs, the numbers, and the entire field. Every aspect of it. So then
            I pursued Economics, and finished with a BA. Doing this made me learn so much about myself, my capabilities, and how far I could go with what I loved doing. I now found a new passion, and graduated in 4 years, on June 2020.
        </p>
        <h4 id="list-item-3">Continued Education</h4>
        <p>After graduating from UCR, I was thrown into the terrifying waters that is the real world. In other words, the workforce. It was a scary time, especially because of the sudden news of the pandemic, and many other scary events that happened around us. It was a time of uncertainty.  
            It's difficult enough to find work after engaging yourself in the university lifestyle. I knew I needed to step up my game if I wanted to my noticed by the workforce. And I already knew I excelled in data analytics. I only lacked the tools to get where I wanted: the programming 
            experience that most data analyst positions required. This is where my continued education comes in. I decided to take the initiative to enroll myself in UCI's Division of Continued Education for Data Analytics. It was a scary step because of how pricey the program seemed. On top of that, 
            I had no prior knowledge of programming other than using Stata, a basic software used mainly for statistics and basic data science. This was an intensive program -- a bootcamp actually. But the bootcamp would not only give me the certification of Data Analyst, but it would also teach me many 
            different programming tools and languages, such as Advanced Excel (VBA), Python, SQL, MongoDB, HTML and CSS, Javascript, and so much more.
